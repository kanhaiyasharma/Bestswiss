Create custom category pages: Add content to category pages and specify a headline and page title to improve the UX and SEO of Category Pages.

== Description ==

WP Custom Category Pages ([official plugin page](http://geoffkenyon.com/wp-custom-category-pages)) lets you customize your category pages by adding content, creating custom headlines (h1 tags), and specifying a page title. With this plugin, it is incredibly simple to customize your category pages and turn them into useful landing pages.

Placing content on your category pages is fast and easy – the plugin utilizes the WordPress text editor, the same editor used to write blog posts.

Additionally, WP Custom Category Pages rids your site of the duplicate content that currently plagues category pages by removing the post snippets all together while leaving the post title. The plugin displays 25 posts at a time on the category page, allowing faster browsing for users and reducing the amount of pagination on the site.
